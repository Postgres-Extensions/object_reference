/*
 * Structural signature dump for every object that belongs to an extension
 * (pg_depend deptype = 'e'), used by bin/structural_diff to compare a
 * database reached via an extension UPDATE against a FRESH install of the
 * same target version. Any nonempty diff between two runs of this query is a
 * bug: the two paths are supposed to produce byte-identical objects.
 *
 * Run via: psql -d DBNAME -v extname="'object_reference'" -f bin/structural_diff.sql
 *
 * Modeled on cat_tools's bin/structural_diff.sql (Postgres-Extensions/
 * cat_tools), which generalized a manual comparison technique (diffing
 * pg_get_functiondef / pg_get_viewdef / type labels / comments / ACLs /
 * extension membership between a fresh install and an updated database) used
 * to find a real fresh-vs-update divergence in that extension. This file is
 * copied near-verbatim -- it is written generically off pg_depend's deptype
 * = 'e' membership edge, with no cat_tools-specific object names, so it
 * applies to object_reference (and any other extension) as-is; only the
 * default :extname in bin/structural_diff's wrapper differs.
 *
 * Emits one text block per member object, ordered by its pg_describe_object()
 * identity so the SAME object sorts to the SAME position regardless of the
 * OIDs assigned along each installation path. Each block covers:
 *   - a structural definition, using pg_get_functiondef/pg_get_viewdef for
 *     routines/views, an ordered column dump for a plain table or standalone
 *     composite type, an ordered label list for enums, or a cast/domain
 *     summary -- whichever a member's catalog/kind actually calls for.
 *     object_reference currently has no enums, domains or casts of its own;
 *     those branches are kept anyway (harmless no-ops today) so a future
 *     member of one of those kinds is compared structurally too, without
 *     needing to remember to add it. Row types implicitly created BY a
 *     member relation, and the array type shadowing any other member type,
 *     are skipped: their structure is fully captured by the relation/base-
 *     type entry already, so listing them again would just duplicate that
 *     comparison under a second identity.
 *   - its comment (pg_description), generically via obj_description().
 *   - its ACL, generically via whichever ACL column its catalog has (proacl /
 *     typacl / relacl / nspacl); sorted, since grant order is not meaningful.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT specific to object_reference's current object
 * list: any object kind this extension does not (yet) use falls through to
 * the ELSE branch below, which still includes it (via its
 * pg_describe_object identity, comment and ACL) so a future new member is
 * compared at least at that level rather than silently skipped, even though
 * this file does not (yet) know how to render a structural definition for
 * it.
